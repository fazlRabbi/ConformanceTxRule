# ConformanceTxRule
Static analysis of conformance preserving transformation rule


Please follow the steps below to use the prototype implementation:

1. Download the project including all the files under src/
2. The data.js file contains a sample model, predicate, constraint and a transformation rule specified in JSON format
3. Edit the data.js file to specify the modelling elements for your experiment but follow the same JSON format
4. Open the index.html file in your favorite editor (make sure that javascript is enabled).
5. If everything works fine, you should see a visualization of model and transformation rules in your web browser.
6. You should also find a list of your predicates in a drop-down list.
7. Selecting a predicate should allow you to visualize it in the web browser. 
8. All the constraints should be listed in another drop-down beside the drop-down for predicates. 
9. Selecting a constraint from the drop down will illustrate the mapping with the same color as shown for the modeling elements in the model.
10. You can check for the conformance of the transformation rule by pressing the 'Check conformance' button found at the bottom of the page.
